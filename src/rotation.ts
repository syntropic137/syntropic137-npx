/**
 * Credential rotation for the three generated service secrets.
 *
 * Rotation was disabled (#56) because it wrote new secret files, restarted the
 * stack, and left every client presenting a password the SERVER had never
 * adopted. The stated reason for leaving it disabled was that this breaks the
 * system "with no safe recovery path". The first half is right. The second half
 * is not, and it is why this stayed off:
 *
 *   The postgres image ships `local all all trust` in pg_hba.conf, so
 *   `ALTER ROLE ... PASSWORD` over the container's own socket succeeds WITHOUT
 *   the old password. Recovery is always available, which means rollback can
 *   never be locked out by the failure it is recovering from.
 *
 * The other half of the original diagnosis was also right, and is the reason
 * this module exists rather than a loop over three files: each server adopts a
 * new credential by a DIFFERENT mechanism, measured 2026-09-07 against the
 * images this project actually pins.
 *
 *   postgres  the password lives in the database. POSTGRES_PASSWORD is honoured
 *             only at initdb; changing it and restarting leaves the server on
 *             the ORIGINAL password. Adoption requires ALTER ROLE.
 *   redis     requirepass is read from the secret file at start, and CONFIG SET
 *             changes it on a live server. Adoption can be immediate.
 *   minio     root credentials come from the environment at EVERY start and are
 *             not persisted. Adoption happens on recreate; the old password is
 *             rejected immediately afterwards.
 *
 * The invariant this module exists to hold:
 *
 *   A rotation is never reported as successful without authenticating to the
 *   service with the new value. Writing a file is not evidence. That gap is the
 *   whole defect: the disabled implementation changed files, reported success,
 *   and the mismatch surfaced at the next restart instead.
