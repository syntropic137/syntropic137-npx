# Development

## Setup

```sh
git clone https://github.com/syntropic137/syntropic137-npx.git
cd syntropic137-npx
npm install        # Dev deps only: typescript, vitest, @types/node
npm run build      # tsc → dist/
npm test           # vitest
node dist/cli.js --help
```

TypeScript strict mode is required. No `any` types.

## Template sync

The `templates/` directory contains files vendored from the main [syntropic137/syntropic137](https://github.com/syntropic137/syntropic137) repo. When a new platform version is released:

1. The main repo triggers a `workflow_dispatch` via `gh workflow run` (notification only)
2. The `template-sync.yml` workflow opens a PR with the updated templates
3. A human reviews and merges the PR
4. A human triggers the `publish.yml` workflow to publish to npm

The main repo cannot merge PRs or publish to npm. See [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md) for why this matters.
